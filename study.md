# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
Models are classes that communicate with a database to read, write, and update
structured data.
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
Controllers accept user input, decide which model methods to perform, and
return outputs to the view layer.
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
A Rails router accepts URLs and sends them to a controller to perform specific
actions. Routers also generate URLs and paths used by views.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
The Rails application receives an incoming GET request to a URL and sends it to
the router to match with a specific controller action, along with any relevant
arguments passed with the request. The controller action calls a model method,
which returns its output as a response to the view layer in the user's browser.
```
